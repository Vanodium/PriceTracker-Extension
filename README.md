This is my chrome extension, which interracts with [API](https://github.com/Vanodium/PriceTracker-API) to add/remove/display price trackers, which will notify you in case it changes

To start tracking price, hold **shift** and **click** on it directly. Now you can open extension and press <img width="13" alt="**+**" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74a6b41d-5fed-4180-9da6-359a34fa3d91"> to start tracking!
